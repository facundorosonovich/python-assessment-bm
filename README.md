Problem Statement: Applying SOLID Principles in Page Object Model (POM) Refactoring for Playwright

Objective:

You are tasked with refactoring a test automation project for a web application that uses Playwright. The project currently lacks adherence to SOLID principles, and your goal is to refactor it while focusing on the following principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Ensure that classes have a single responsibility and that each class is responsible for one aspect of the automation workflow.
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Design the code so that it is open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for easy extension of functionality without altering existing code.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Make sure that subclasses can be used interchangeably with the base class without breaking test expectations.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Create interfaces that specify the methods relevant to the classes implementing them, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Use abstractions (e.g., base classes or interfaces) to allow for dependency injection, enabling flexibility in managing dependencies.


Requirements:
Ensure that the refactored code follows SOLID principles, resulting in clean, maintainable, and modular code.
The Playwright library is used for browser automation.
Replace placeholders such as "your_username" and "your_password" with actual login credentials for your application.
Organize your project structure according to best practices for maintainability and scalability.
